# EmonLibCM (AVR-DB Branch)

This is an adaptation of Robert Wall's EmonLibCM library to work with the AVR-DB microcontrollers.

See Robert Wall's original forum release: [EmonLibCM](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emonlibcm-version-2-03/9241/1)

The following release notes are copied from the forum thread. The installation section is modified to reflect git command line installation.

## EmonLibCM Release notes

EmonLibCM is a Continuous Monitoring alternative to EmonLib. Whereas emonLib repeats, every 5 or 10 s, a sequence of voltage and current measurements in each of the input channels for a short period, normally 200 ms, and then reports the measurements back to the sketch for onwards transmission to (for example) emonCMS; emonLibCM continuously measures in the background the voltage and all the current input channels in turn, calculates a true average quantity for each and then informs the sketch that the measurements are available and should be read and processed.

Temperature measurement with up to 6 DS18B20 sensors, and pulse counting, is included in the library. Neither must be added separately in the sketch.

The CM library will always give an accurate measurement of the average over the reporting period of the voltage, and for each of up to 5 channels the current, real and apparent power and power factor. A cumulative total of Watt-hours for each channel is also available. It is suitable for single phase or split phase operation at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. It will give more accurate values than the 'discrete sample' sketch where rapidly switched loads are in use, for example a burst mode energy diverter or an induction hob.

The inputs can be calibrated for any realistic voltage and current, the default calibration is for an emonTx with a UK a.c. adapter and 100 A : 50 mA current transformers.

The library is distributed as a compressed Zip file. This contains the library files themselves (emonLibCM.cpp & emonLibCM.h), two directories with example sketches and a PDF format User Documentation file that contains notes on using the library, a full description of each method, instructions both for setting the initial configuration and for calibration, and brief notes explaining the example sketches. EmonLibCM also depends on several other libraries, and these are listed.

## Installing The Library

### Arduino IDE

#### From Zip file

The directory emonLibCM together with its contents should be extracted from the zip file and copied into the "libraries" directory, alongside (in the same level of the hierarchy as) the emonLib directory.

If you wish to use the example sketches, these (in their respective directories) should be moved or copied into your Sketchbook.

The User Documentation PDF file can be moved or copied to a convenient location of your choosing.

#### GitHub

Navigate to your Arduino libraries directory and clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonLibCM.git

Reload Arduino to start using the library.

## Changelog

Version 3.0 includes AVR-DB specific changes:

- Version 3.0.4 21/11/2022   Option to return channel mean value
- Version 3.0.3 05/10/2022   Fix online configuration
- Version 3.0.2 20/08/2022   6 channel support
- Version 3.0.1 07/07/2022   SAMP PIN lower level IO 
- Version 3.0.0 20/04/2022   AVR-DB branch

Version 2.0 corrected some errors generated when converting from the original sketch, and incorporates improved handling of phase/timing compensation and improved removal of the d.c. bias. There are no other major changes from the version that has been tested by @TrystanLea since early 2017.

- Changes for V2.01: Errors in phase error correction.

- Changes for V2.02: Temperature measurement: Added "BAD_TEMPERATURE" return value when reporting period < 0.2 s, getLogicalChannel( ), ReCalibrate_VChannel( ), ReCalibrate_IChannel( ) added, setPulsePin( ) interrupt no. was obligatory, pulse & temperatures were set/enabled only at startup, setTemperatureDataPin was ineffective, preloaded sensor addresses were not handled properly.

- Changes for V2.03: Mains Frequency reporting with getLineFrequency( ) added,  energy calculation changed to use the internal clock rather than mains time. ADC reference source was AV<sub>CC</sub> and not selectable - ability to select using setADC_VRef( ) added (Note the warning in the documentation regarding the use of this function).

- Changes for V2.04: getDatalog_period() has been added, the datalogging period now has a minimum value of 0.1 s. The list of temperature sensor addresses is now ignored if first device is not a DS18B20. 'BAD_TEMPERATURE' is now returned if sensor address is made invalid during operation, and 'UNUSED_TEMPERATURE' is returned for all addresses above the number of sensors detected. The sensor power pin (if used) is now always set low after a reading, and when temperature readings are disabled. The resolution of the temperature measurements is reduced when datalogging faster than once per second is requested, and temperature measurement is disabled when datalogging faster than 5 per second is set. In the example sketches, an 'else' clause has added to "if (EmonLibCM_Ready())" to keep JeeLib alive, and a third example sketch, only for emonTx's with a RFM69CW, using the  JeeLib 'Classic' message format but not using JeeLib itself, has been added. There have also been some cosmetic changes.

## USING THE LIBRARY

Three example sketches are provided as part of the distribution:
**EmonTxV34CM_min** is the absolute minimum sketch required to exercise the library and produce meaningful values.
**EmonTxV34CM_max** gives an example of every API call available. However, as distributed, it actually changes nothing as everything is again given the default value. If you need to change one of the defaults, then only the API call that sets that value is needed, and you can copy and add that call to the "minimum' demo sketch.
**EmonTxV34CM_min_RFM69** is essentially the same as *EmonTxV34CM_min*, but uses the code in the file  ``rfm.ino`` to drive the RFM69CW radio, so making better use of the RFM69's capabilities and minimising disturbance to the energy sampling.

The EmonLibCM library is not a direct replacement for the 'discrete sample' library emonLib. Significant changes will be need to be made if emonLibCM is to replace emonLib in any particular sketch.
The example sketches are intended only as a demonstration of the library. They do not (for example) take any account of the DIP switch settings of the emonTx V3.4. Great care must be taken if any significant additional load is to be put on the processor.
